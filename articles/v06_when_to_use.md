# Parallelization strategies

One may be confused about when to use what parallelization strategy.
This vignette guides users to choose the right parallelization strategy
for their use cases.

## Row parallelization

Row parallelization stands for the parallelization of a single function
call across multiple rows of a data frame or a list. This is the most
common use case for parallelization, and it is often the easiest to
implement. The `future` package provides a simple and consistent
interface for row parallelization.

In geospatial analysis, row parallelization is useful when you have a
large number of spatial features and each row can be processed
independently.

``` r

library(future)
library(futurize)
library(terra)
library(chopin)

sa <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")) |>
  sf::st_transform(crs = 5070)  # Assume this is a large sf object
data(ncpoints)
sb <- ncpoints |>
  sf::st_as_sf(coords= c("X", "Y"), crs=5070) |>
  sf::st_buffer(5000)  # Assume this is another large sf object

# You may want to replace the two lines below with your own large vector datasets for testing.
# sa <- __large_vector_data__  # Assume this is a large vector dataset
# sb <- __large_vector_data__  # Assume this is another large vector dataset
```

Suppose sb is smaller than sa, and we want to run a function, a binary
operation, on each row of sa with sb. We can use the `futurize` function
to parallelize this operation across the rows of sa.

``` r

func_row <- function(row, foo) {
  sb_s <- sb[row, ]
  sa_s <- sa[sb_s, ]
  foo(sa_s, sb_s)
}

future::plan(multisession, workers = 2L)
system.time(
lapply(1:nrow(sa), func_row, foo = sf::st_intersection) |>
  futurize::futurize()
)

future::plan(sequential)
```

It should work as `sf` object is directly exported to the worker
process. However, the one below should fail due to `terra` object’s
pointer state.

``` r

func_row_t <- function(row, foo) {
  sbt_s <- sbt[row, ]
  sat_s <- sat[sbt_s, ]
  foo(sat_s, sbt_s)
}

sat <- terra::vect(sa)
sbt <- terra::vect(sb)

future::plan(multisession, workers = 2L)
system.time(
  jj <- lapply(1:nrow(sat), func_row_t, foo = terra::intersect) |>
    futurize::futurize(options = futurize_options(seed = TRUE))
)

future::plan(sequential)
```

The code above will fail with “external pointer is not valid” error. As
one might have noted, in the main
[`lapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html) call, we passed the
sequence of row indices to the function, which is then used to subset
the `sf` object.

One caveat is that most use cases suffice to use ordinary function run
(i.e., terra) as internal loop runs efficiently. In this case, row
parallelization may not be necessary and may even introduce overhead.

``` r

func_in <- function(row, foo) {
  sa_s <- sa[row, ]
  foo(sa_s, sb)
}

system.time(
  intersect_1 <- lapply(1:nrow(sa), func_in, foo = sf::st_nearest_feature) |>
    futurize::futurize() |>
    do.call(what = rbind)
)

system.time(
  intersect_2 <- sf::st_nearest_feature(sa, sb)
)

all.equal(as.vector(intersect_1), intersect_2)
# TRUE
```

`chopin` functions, especially
[`chopin::extract_at()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/chopin/reference/extract_at.md),
do not operate with `futurize::futurize()` since it uses
`future::future_lapply()` and auto-detects package dependencies of input
objects internally.

Then, when would you expect the benefit of `chopin` parallelization? We
suggest three conditions of the cases where `chopin` parallelization is
beneficial:

1.  The input data is large enough to be split into multiple chunks, and
    each chunk can be processed independently.

2.  The processing function is completed within a processing extent that
    is supported by the `chopin` `par_*()` functions. In other words,
    one understands the maximum required extent of the processed data
    per chunk, and the processing function does not require data outside
    of that extent.

3.  The processing function is computationally intensive enough that the
    overhead of parallelization is outweighed by the speedup gained from
    processing multiple chunks in parallel.
